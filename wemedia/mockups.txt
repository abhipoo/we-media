The coronavirus scare feels like a warlike situation now. With curbs on travel, and falling state of economy, the prices of day to day commodities seem to be increasing. Who governs the price increase ? Also, I'd like to read / watch about how we function as a society. We take a lot of stuff for granted.. like how the food on my table reached me. And how other basic necessities like electricity and internet continue to work in the face of a disaster.
